Just like that, the Contraindicator app has been installed on your PC and you can get it by searching on the Windows start menu as well!

## Launching the Application
Search for "Contraindicator" on the Windows start menu and open it. This will open the web application on localhost on port 5000 on your default web browser.


## Introduction
The main focus of the application is to display the presence and severity of various interactions between about 2000 drugs. The application provides a clean responsive user interface that can be used to get ultrafast results with minimal steps. 
## Dashboard
As soon as you open the application, you can find an input field where you can enter drug names along with some buttons like "Add Tag", "Confirm" and "Reset List".
## Features and Usage
Click on the input field to display the list of all the drugs to choose from. As you type the common name of your desired drug, the search results are displayed on the dropdown menu and you can select using up/down arrow keys and add by simply clicking on the 'Add Tag" button or hitting the 'enter' key on your keyboard. This will add the drug as a tag and show up above the input field. You can keep track of all the drugs being added here and remove if you wish to. 

Once you add the drugs of your choice, press "Confirm" or hit "Shift + Enter" on your keyboard to confirm all the drugs you added for another time before submitting. You may still choose to remove unwanted drugs at this point.

Then, simply click on "Submit" to submit the list of drugs and our API will provide you with lightning fast results showing the various interactions between the drugs if present.
